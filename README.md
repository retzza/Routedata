# Routedata

Routedata is my first ever Javascript project to plot all gps data from Polar watch to a single map.

## Usage

After following Polar's instructions on https://support.polar.com/en/how-to-download-all-your-data-from-polar-flow to get all data from polar, add all training-session files to the folder training_sessions for the program to work.
